 Actually it's both of us.,Chandler,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends
 What?,Monica,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends
 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,Chandler,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends
 Oh... what does that mean?,Monica,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends
 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...,Chandler,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends
 Chandler?,Monica,Episode-21- The One With The Fertility Test,Season-09,Friends

" And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.",Doctor Connelly,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends

 Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get p0rn if you're giving a sperm sample.,Chandler,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
 So-so what did the doctor say?,Ross,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
" Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",Chandler,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
 So you're ruling out surrogacy?,Joey,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
 Yeah.,Chandler,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
" So, I don't have to learn what that means?",Joey,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends

" Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",Chandler,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
" No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",Monica,Episode-22-The One With The Donor,Season-09,Friends
