# LLM Capstone Projects
This repository contains several cool open-source limited-scope capstone projects I'm working on to grow my hands-on expertise on LLMs.

**1. Chandler-BOT:** This model is developed as a tribute to my favorite character "Chandler" from the popular American Sitcom "FRIENDS". I gathered the whole script of all 10 seasons of FRIENDS, and collected Chandler's dialogues. I then fine-tuned a sharded version of LLama2-7b from TinyPixel/Llama-2-7B-bf16-sharded available in HuggingFace. I fine-tuned it via AutoTrain using PEFT to make it learn how Chandler talks with humor, wit and fun. The model is available [nafisneehal/chandler-bot](https://huggingface.co/nafisneehal/chandler-bot) through HuggingFace. I am currently working on (i) improving it's performance, and (ii) writing a quick FLASK app to deploy this model through HEROKU. `LLM` `HuggingFace` `Llama 2 7B` `FineTune` `AutoTrain`
